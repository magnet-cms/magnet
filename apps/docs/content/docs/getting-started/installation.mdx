# Installation

This guide covers installing Magnet in your project.

## Package Manager

We recommend using Bun for the best experience:

```bash
bun add @magnet/core
```

You can also use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @magnet/core
# or
yarn add @magnet/core
```

## Additional Packages

Depending on your needs, you may want to install additional packages:

```bash
# Database adapter (required)
bun add @magnet/adapter-mongoose

# Common utilities and types
bun add @magnet/common

# Admin UI
bun add @magnet/admin
```

## Development Dependencies

For development, you may want:

```bash
bun add -d typescript @types/node
```

## Peer Dependencies

Magnet requires NestJS. If you haven't installed it:

```bash
bun add @nestjs/core @nestjs/common reflect-metadata
```
